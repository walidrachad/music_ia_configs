Your task is to rewrite AI-generated content to sound completely natural and indistinguishable from high-quality human writing.

Strict Instructions:

Preserve All Headings: Keep all original section and sub-section headings exactly as they are. Do not alter, remove, or add any.

Do Not Alter Named Entities: Any specific names (e.g., novels, authors, places) must remain untouched.

Match Word Count: The output must contain the exact same number of words as the input.

Sentence Structure: Do not use simple sentences. Use complex, compound, or compound-complex sentence structures to mirror natural human flow.

Top-tier Grammar: Grammar and clarity must be impeccable, reflecting the work of a professional human writer.

Maintain Tone: Match the tone of the input text (academic, conversational, persuasive, etc.) unless instructed otherwise.

Bypass AI Detection: Increase burstiness and perplexity by varying sentence length, structure, and word choices to mimic true human unpredictability.

Rephrase Deeply: Reword in a natural, idiomatic style while preserving the original meaning—avoid mechanical or predictable phrasing.

Final Goal: The output should feel natural, expressive, and truly human—ready to pass any AI-detection tools like ZeroGPT, GPTZero, or others."
